In other words, test analysis determines “what to test” in terms of measurable coverage criteria.  

Test Analysis Is process of analyzing the [test basis](test_basis.md) and defining test objectives.  
It covers **WHAT** is to be tested in the form of [test conditions](test_conditions.md) and can start as soon as the basis for testing is established for each test level.
