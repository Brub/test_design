# Test Basis

## What is test basis?
Test basis is defined as the source of information or the document that is needed to write test cases and also for [test analysis](test_analysis.md).

Test basis should be well defined and adequately structured so that one can easily identify test conditions from which test cases can be derived.

**Examples of test basises:**  
* AUT (Application Under Test)  
* user experiance  
* documentation  
* system requirement


It is very useful if the test basis (for any level or type of testing that is being considered) has measurable coverage criteria defined.

For example, for a mobile application, the test basis may include a list of requirements and a list of supported mobile devices.
