# Test design (TD)

## What is test design?
Test design defines **HOW** something can be tested.  
It identifies the test cases by elaborating the test conditions identified in test analysis phase or from test basis.

As a tester you need to use test design techniques which are identified in the test strategy or test plan.

## When can test design start?
Designing can start for a given test level once the [test conditions](test_conditions.md) are identified and enough information is available to produce test cases.

During test designing we need to be very specific about the test cases that we create.

We need to have very specific inputs, steps and data for each test case that we create during test designing.

Test designing requires detailed analysis and understanding of requirements.

Test Analysts need to first apply static testing techniques like reviews, walkthroughs to understand the requirements in detail.
