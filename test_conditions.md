# Test conditions

## What is a test condition?
In simple terms, test condition is something that can be tested by us.

A test condition is simply something that we could test.

While identifying the test conditions we want to identify as many conditions as we can and then we select about which one to take forward and combine into test cases. We could call them test possibilities.
